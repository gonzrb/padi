1- How does the body respond to excess heat?

- Overheating (hyperthermia) is a potential problem for divers when fully suited on a hot day
- The body responds to excess heat progressively by first dilating the skin capillaries to promote cooling
    - If this doesn't help, perspiration starts to cool the skin through evaporation
    - The next step is to accelerate the pulse to circulate blood faster for cooling
    - These processes continue until the body cools
    - If cooling doesn't occur, the process continues until the body reaches it's physical limnit - heat exhaustion or heat stroke
    - Heat exhaustion occurs when the body works at full capacity to cool
        - Signs and symptoms are a weak and rapid pulse, profuse perspiration, cool and clammy skin, nausea and weakness
        - A person needs to cool off - remove a heavy exposure suit or cool in the water
    - Heat stroke results if the body reaches it's limits and fails to cool
        - Perspiration ceases, a person's skin is hot and flushed and pulse is strong but rapid
        - This is an emergency medical condition that can cause serious damage to the brain and body systems

2- How does the body respond to insufficient heat?

- Water conducts heat 20 times faster than air, which is why we chill faster in even relatively warm water
- As the body loses heat, it responds progressively:
    - Reducing blood flow to the extremities - fingers and toes go numb
    - Shivering to generate heat through muscle activity - signals you are losing the battle against the cold
- Uncontrollable shivering procedes the core body temperature dropping - hypothermia
- AS protective responses fail, shivering stops and diver feels warm, but core temperature continues to drop
    - Mental processes slow and the diver becomes drowsy, uncoordinated and forgetful
    - Advanced hypothermia is a medical emergency requiring emergency care
