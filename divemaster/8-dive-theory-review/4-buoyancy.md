1- How do you change an object's buoyancy by increasing displacement or adding weight to make it positively, negatively or neutrally buoyant in both freshwater and salt water?

- Archimedes principle:
    - An object wholly or partially immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object
- To decrease buoyancy - add weight or decrease displacement
- Example:
    - If wearing a thick wet suit, hood, gloves and boots, you will likely float
    - To become neutral or negative you must put on weight system
- To increase buoyancy - displace more water or release weight
    - Attach a device that can be filled with air - lift bag 
- Displacing water qual to object's weight 
    - neutrally buoyant
- Greater displacemnent
    - positively buoyant
- To change the buoyancy of object that is neutral:
    - Add weight
    - Decraase volume or displacement
    - Increase volume or displacement
- A diver who is neutrally buoyant:
    - Picks up a heavy weight - becomes negative
    - Lets air out of the BCD - becomes negative
    - Adds too much air to the BCD - becomes positive
- The denser the water - the greater the buoyancy
    - An object will be more buoyant in salt water than in fresh
