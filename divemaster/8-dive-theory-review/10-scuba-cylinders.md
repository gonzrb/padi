1- How do you identify, and what are the meanings of, the following scuba cylinder marks, alloy designation, hydrostatic test date and working pressure?

- Scuba cylinders have various marking stamped at the neck that provide information
    - The goverment agency responsible for approving compressed gas containers
    - The type of metal used (alloy designation)
    - The maximum pressure
- Be familiar with the cylinder markings and know how to identify when the last hydrostatic test was completed and the working pressure
- initial hydrostatic test date - the last item in the last row
    - consists of numbers representing month and year
    - Numbers separated by hydrostatic tester's initials or tester's special registered symbol
    - Subsequent hydrostatic test dates may appear anywhere on neck
- Marked with a maximum pressure
    - Pso (pounds per square inch)
    - Bar
    - MP (mega-pascal)

2- What are the different types of cylinder valves?

- A cylinder is fitted with a standard chrome plated brass vavle
    - either yoke system or DIM system
- Yoke system
    - The regulator fits down over the valve
        - First stage opening meets valve's high pressure opening
        - Tightened in place with yoke screw
        - Seals against valve's o-ring
- DIN stands for Deutsche Industrie-Norm - a German national standards organization
    - With the DIN system, the sealing o-ring mounts on the regulator, which screws into the DIN valve
    - The five thread DIN fitting can be used for pressures up to 200 bar/3000 psi
    - The seven thread DIN fitting for higher working pressures

3- What device prevents an over-pressurized cylinder form exploding and how does it work?

- A burst disk is part of many cylinder valves - protects against damage from:
    - accidental overfilling
    - accidental overheating
- Not used in some countries
- If cylinder pressure rises to 140% of working pressure, disk ruptures and air escapes though vented plug
- A burst-disk assembly consist of a thin copper disk held in place with a gasket and a vented plug
- Burst disks need to be replaced periodically - they weaken over time

4- Why should a cylinder receive an annual visual inspection?

- It's a dive community standard for cylinders to be visually inspected each year
    - valves are inspected and o-rings replaced as needed
- Three general reasons to detect:
    - Exterior damage - severe scratches or dents that can weaken cylinder
    - Interior corrosion that can weaken cylinder and clog valve
    - Galvanic action between dissimilar metals of cylinder and valve threads
    - Threads can seize, making it impossible to remove valve - makes cylinder useless
- Inspection should occur
    - HEar loose material rolling around or sloshing water
    - Any exterior damage
    - Seems heavier than it should be 
    - Burst dics fails or cylinder completely emptied
    - Air inside smells unusual or cylinder filled by compressor through to be defective
    - After long term storage or when cylinder's history is unkown
- A decal is attached noting the inspection date
- Be familiar with decals used in your area

5- What are the steps and procedures of a hydrostatic test?

- To determine that a cylinder is structurally sound, many countries require periodic hydrostatic testing
    - Test procedures vary from region to region
- General Steps:
    - The cylinder is filled with water and placed into a water-filled contained
    - The cylinder is pressurized to a specified test pressure for a minimum of 30 seconds
    - 5/3 or 3/2 cylinder's listed pressure
    - At test pressure, total expansion is recoded - amount of water displaced from container
- General steps:
    - The pressure is released, the cylinder contracts and the displaced water is returned to the container
    - The remaining dispalced water represents the permanent expansion of the cylinder
        - If the expansion is within specific limits - the cylinder passes the test and received a new stamped test date
        - if expansion is too high, the metal has fatighed and the cylinder is condemned
- Beyond required intervals, have a cylinder tested if it:
    - Has sustained impact damage
    - Has been exposed to etreme heat:
        - In excess of about 82*C/10*F
        - because molecules structure of metal may have been altered
            - Cylinders made from some alloys particularly aluminum - are condemned after heat exposure
        - Has any signs of stress or weakening

6- What functional problems can occur with cylinders an valves?

- You need to be aware of waht preoblems can occur with cylinders and valves - to prevent or handle
- The most common cylinder problem - diver doesn't properly secure it in the BCD
    - May slip out, or it may be too high
    - Watch for cylinders that are not attached or adjusted properly
- If a cylinder has internal corrosion - flakes and debris that accumulate can start to clog the valve or regulator
- Again, this is why visual inspections are so important
- The most common valve problem is a worn o-ring
    - Indicated by a small string of bubbles
    - Not a big concern but it does indicate that the o-ring needs to be replaced
    - A major leak calls for aborting dive due to rapid air loss
- Making a habit of checking and changing o-rings frequenly
Another problem occurs when a diver turns the valve on and then off, but doesn't purge the pressure
    - The SPG will continue to show a full cylinder and the diver may enter the water with the valve off
- A diver may open the valve only partially, then forget to open it completely and begin the dive
    - Identify this problem by observing the diver's SPG
    - Pressure will fail and rise as the diver inhales and exhales
- Encourage divers to perform a predive safety check
