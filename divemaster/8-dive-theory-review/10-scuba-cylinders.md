1- What are the organs, structure and functions fo the circulatory and respiratory systems?

- Rules allow you to dive safety and avoid problems with your circulatory and respiratory systems:
    - Never hold your breath
    - Ascend slowly from every dive
- Besides rules, it's important to understand how diving affects your body's systems
- The systems work together to provide gas and nutrients to the body and eliminate waste
- Through blood, oxygen gets to the tissues via hemoglobin (a protein that carries and releases oxygen)
- After hemoglobin releases oxygen, it binds with carbon dioxide and carries ti to the lungs for elimination
    - Another process - a reversible bicarbonate reaction - also carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs
- Blood is moved around by the cardiovascular system - heart, arteries, veins and capillaries
    - The heart - a four chambered pump - circulates the blood
    - Arteries carry blood away from the heart
    - Veins carry blood toward the heart
    - Capillaries are vessels between arteries and veins
    - Gas exchange occurs in the capillaries
- Cycle starts as oxygen-rich blood from lungs enters left side of heart and is pumped into the aorta
- Aorta branches into smaller arteries and branch in to even smaller arteries, until reaching capillaries
- Blood given up oxygen, picks up carbon dioxide, then flows into the venous system
- Veins branch into larger veins until a single vein returns oxygen-poor blood to right side of the heart
- The hear pumps blood to lungs where it releases carbon dioxide into alveoli
- Blood picks up oxygen and returns to the heart
- Regarding the resporatory cycle - one key point
    - Reflex respiratory centers in the brain monitor carbon dioxide levels in the body
    - When the carbon dioxide level rises, the brain signals diaphragm to flex downward, resulting in an inhalation
    - Carbon dioxide level, not oxygen level, primarily triggers the breathing cycle

2- What is dead air space and how do you avoid problems caused by it? 

- You breath slowly and deeply for a good air exchange
- Natural air space - sinuses, trachea nad snorkel
- Your scuba regulator and snorkel add volume to dead air space
- Slow deep breathing helps compensate for additional dead air space and avoid build up of carbon dioxide
- Shallow breathing raises carbon dioxide levels - increases breathing rate and can lead to overexertion
- To avoid overxertion, always breathe slowly and deeply
- Stop to get your breath back under control

3- How does the body respond when breath-hold diving, and how you can extend breath-hold time?

- As breath-hold diving grows in popularity, people dive deeper and stay down longer on a single breath
- During breath-hold dive, the circulatory system uses oxygen stored in the lungs, muscle and blood
- Underwater, pressure compresses air in the lungs, which allows blood to use more of the remaining oxygen
- As time goes by, carbon dioxide build in the system, causing the urge to breaths
- As the urge grows stronger, the body consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide
- Extend brath-hold time using voluntary hyperventilation
    - Breathe deeply and rapidly for 3 or 4 breaths
- Excessive hyperventilation depletes carbon dioxide, deplays the urge to breathe and may lead to shallow water blackout
    - The body consumes oxygen faster than carbon dioxide accumulates to stimulate breating
    - At depth, there is no immediate problem
    - AS diver ascends and the partial pressure of oxygen falls abruptly
        - causes black out without warning

4- Why should you avoid a wet suit hood or dry suit collar that excessively restricts the neck, and what are the two physiological explanations for the concerns?

- If a wet suit hood or dry suit collar is too tight, it constricts the cardotid arteries and jugular veins
    - Blocked jugular venous return and carotid sinus reflex reduce fresh blood flow to the brain
- Blocking jugular veins reduces flow to brain, because oxygen-poor blood can't exit to make room for fresh blood
    - Raises blood pressure because the heart tries to push againts restriction
- Carotid sinus reflex results if pressure on the carotid arteries is perceived a elevated blood pressure
    - Causes heart to slow, but when pressure doesn't decline, the hear slow further
- Signs and symptons include extreme discomfort, headache, light-headedness, a feeling of choking and fainting
- Avoid this by wearing propertly fitting wet suit hoods and dry suit neck seals
