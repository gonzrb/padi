1- What is the basic structure and operation of the Haldanean decompression model?

- Virtually all dive tables and dive computers calculate no decompression limits and decompression stops based on a Haldanean decompression model
- John Scott Haldane experimented and produced his original model and tables in 1906
- Haidane structured his models based on:
    - At depth, nitrogen pressure in breathing air is higher than in the body, so nitrogen disolves into body tissues
    - Give nenoguh time, the body will saturate and absorb no more nitrogen at that depth
    - During ascent, nitrogen pressure in the body is higher than the surrounding pressure, causing tissues to release nitrogen
    - The difference between the dissolved nitrogen pressure and surrounding pressure is alled the pressure gradient
    - On ascent, tissues can tolerate some gradient without causing decompression sickness (DCS)
    - If the gradient exceeds acceptable limits, bubbles can form, which could result in DCS
    - DCS can be avoided by keeping the gradient within acceptable limits
    - Hardane discovered that different body tissues absorb and release nitrogen at different rates
    - His model consisted of five different tissues compartments (theorical tissues)
    - Modern versions may have 14 or more compartments
    - Each compartment was assigned a halftime in minutes ranging from 5 to 75 minutes
    - Modern models range from 3 to more than 600 minutes

- Halftime - the time it takes a compartment ot go halfway from it's present tissue pressue to saturation at a new depth, in exponential progression
- Each compartment also has a different M-value - the maximum tissue pressure allowerd in the compartment when surfacing to prevent exceeding the acceptable gradient
    - Compartments with shorter halftimes (fast tissues) have a higher M-value
    - Compartments with longer halftimes (slow tissues) have a lower M-value
- Model works by determining how much each compartment theoretically absorbs for a given depth and time
    - When any compartment reaches it's M-value- a no deompression dive ends and that time become the no decompression limit (NDL) for that depth
- On deeper dives, compartments with shorter halftimes absorb nitrogen fastest and usually reach their M-values first
    - Thsi is why deeper dives have short NDLs
- On a shallow dive, the shorter halftime (fast) compartments can't reach their high M-values - the dive is limited by longer halftime (slow) compartments = more no decompression time
- There is no direct relationship between a mathematical decompression model and the body
    - Models are imperfect
    - Rely on one as far as it has been shown to work in tests and field experience
    - Even within those limits there is still risk of DCS

2- For whom was the Recreational Dive Planner developed, and how was it tested?

- Up until mind-1980s, most scuba divers depended on US Navy tabled to plan dives - even though table were developed for military decompression diving
- In the early 1980s Dr. Ray Rogers reasoned that since recreational divers dive differently from navy divers, perhaps different tables would be appropiate
    - Proposed that repetitive diving could be based on a faster halftime - 60 minutes instead of the Us Navy's 120 minutes - because recreational diving is limited to no stop diving
    - Data suggested that the maximum allowable nitrogen limits for recreational divers should be somewhat lower than those on the US Navy tables
        - Diving Science & Technology (DSAT), a corporate affiliate of PADI organized and funded a study through the IAPM (Institute of Applied Physiology and Medicide) in Seattle, Washington, USA to test Rogers' hypothesis
- The tests covered a broad demographic range
    - Males, fales, younger and older divers and people with differing physical types
- Test ewre evaluated based on Doppler detectable silet bubbles, not just whether a diver experienced DCS
- More than 1000 divers were made in the hyperbaric chamber and open water - demostrating the validity of RDP concepts
- in October 1989, Dr. Michael Powell of IAPM DELIVERED TEST RESULTS AND IN 1988, DSAT Recreational Dive Planner (RDP) distributed byPADI was released.
- RDP introduced several formats:
    - RDP Table - 1988
    - The wheel - 1988 - first table developed to allow multilevel no stop diving
    - EANx RDPs - 1995
    eRDP - 2005 - first electronic dive table
    eRDPml - 2008 - electronic dive table that has multilevel dive planning capabilities

3- Why do you need to know your approximate altitude when diving?

- Dive tables and dive computers were developed for dives starting and ending at sea level
    - At altitude, you start and end in air pressure less than at sea level
- Pressure gradient between theoretical gas dissolved in tissues and atmospheric pressue is greater than designed into the Haldanean decompression model
    - To account for this difference, follow atitude diving procedures
- Knowing the approximate altitude allows you to:
    - Find a pressure group on the RDP table or eRDPtm, that accounts for the highter level of nitrogen, if you ascended from a lower altitutde less than six hours before the dive
    - Use the Theoretical Depth at Altitude table to convert actual depth to theoretical depth
    - Set your dive computer for the correct atitutde - if it doesn't automatically adjust

4- How do dive computers apply decompression models to provide more no stop dive time?

- Dive computers offer maximum botton time by essentially writting a custom dive table for the exat dive
    - Computers microprocessor contiuosly plugs information about dive into it's mathematical decomrpession model, estimating how much nitrogen has gone into solution in tissues
- Different computers use differing models (algorithms) and may vary in NDLs, time allowed on repetitive dives and credit for ascending to a shallower depth
    - Differences are not substantial
