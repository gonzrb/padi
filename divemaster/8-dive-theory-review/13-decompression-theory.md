1- What is the basic structure and operation of the Haldanean decompression model?

- Virtually all dive tables and dive computers calculate no decompression limits and decompression stops based on a Haldanean decompression model
- John Scott Haldane experimented and produced his original model and tables in 1906
- Haidane structured his models based on:
    - At depth, nitrogen pressure in breathing air is higher than in the body, so nitrogen disolves into body tissues
    - Give nenoguh time, the body will saturate and absorb no more nitrogen at that depth
    - During ascent, nitrogen pressure in the body is higher than the surrounding pressure, causing tissues to release nitrogen
    - The difference between the dissolved nitrogen pressure and surrounding pressure is alled the pressure gradient
    - On ascent, tissues can tolerate some gradient without causing decompression sickness (DCS)
    - If the gradient exceeds acceptable limits, bubbles can form, which could result in DCS
    - DCS can be avoided by keeping the gradient within acceptable limits
    - Hardane discovered that different body tissues absorb and release nitrogen at different rates
    - His model consisted of five different tissues compartments (theorical tissues)
    - Modern versions may have 14 or more compartments
    - Each compartment was assigned a halftime in minutes ranging from 5 to 75 minutes
    - Modern models range from 3 to more than 600 minutes

- Halftime - the time it takes a compartment ot go halfway from it's present tissue pressue to saturation at a new depth, in exponential progression
- Each compartment also has a different M-value - the maximum tissue pressure allowerd in the compartment when surfacing to prevent exceeding the acceptable gradient
    - Compartments with shorter halftimes (fast tissues) have a higher M-value
    - Compartments with longer halftimes (slow tissues) have a lower M-value
- Model works by determining how much each compartment theoretically absorbs for a given depth and time
    - When any compartment reaches it's M-value- a no deompression dive ends and that time become the no decompression limit (NDL) for that depth
- On deeper dives, compartments with shorter halftimes absorb nitrogen fastest and usually reach their M-values first
    - Thsi is why deeper dives have short NDLs

2- For whom was the Recreational Dive Planner developed, and how was it tested?
