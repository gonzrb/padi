1- How does a scuba regulator work?

- A regulator delivers air (or enriched air) from your cylinder at the same pressure as the pressure surrounding you
- The first stage reduces high pressure to an intermediate pressure
    - Abouit 10 to 13 bar, 1000/3000Kpa, or 140 to 190 psi, above ambient water pressure
    - Intermediate pressure is what's in the hose that leads to the second stage
- When you inhale, the following action occurs
    - Water pressure pushes in second stage diaphragm opening the downstream valve, releasing air
    - This release causes air pressure in first stage to drop, opening a valve that releases air from the cylinder
- When you stop inhaling, the second stage diaphragm returns to it's relaxed position and the drownstream valve closes
- Intermediate pressure builds back up in the hose, closing the first stage valve

2- What is meant by "fail-safe" with respect ot regulators, and how does it work?

- Second stage has a "downstream" valve design, meaning that the valve opens with the air flow
    - Because spring pressure holds the valve closed against air flow, a valve malfunction allows the valve to pen
    - This releases air continuosly in a freflow
- This is called fail-safe because a regulator failure allows diver to get air - fails in a safe manner
    - Divers learn to breathe from a freeflowing regulator so they know how to deal with the situation

3- What is the purpose of a regulator environmental seal?

- Some first stages have environmental seals that help keep regulator from freezing in cold water
- Normal air flow causes a temperature drop in the first stage
- In extrmely cold conditions, water quickly freezes within the first stage causing valves to stick open in a freflowing position
- An environmental seal does nto allow water to directly contact the first stage valve
    - Substantially reducing possibility of freezing

4- What functional problems can occur with regulators?

- Knowing how to handle regulator problems is a key skill ot have
- Most functional problems occur due to inadequate maintenance or servicing
    - The build-up of minerals and salt can increase breathing resistance or keep valves from completely seating - resulting in a constant air leak from the second stage
    - A regulator that has a continuous flow of air needs professional servicing
- Poor maintenance may also result in exhaust valves sticking or failing to seal
    - A stuck exhaust valve can block exhalation, making the regulator unusable
    - An exhaust valve that doesn't seal makes the regulator breathe "wet"
    - In both cases, the regulator needs to be serviced
- Problems with the motuiece include:
    - Divers biting through the bite tabs
    - Small tears that allow water to drizzle in
    - The mouthpiece comes loose, because the plastic tie breaks
- Careful inspection before each use as well as regulator servicing can prevent most regulator problems
