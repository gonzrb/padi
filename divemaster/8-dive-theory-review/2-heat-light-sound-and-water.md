1- Why does water dissipate body heat faster than air does, and at what rate does it do so?

- Water absorbs more heat than air
    - It's denser and forms weak bonds between molecules
    - Conducts heats approximately 20 times faster than air
    - Example - hot metal spooon cools off faster when placed in a glass of water than sitting on the table
- Heat dissipates into water
    - body heat when scuba diving
    - through conduction and convection
        - Conduction is heat trasmition through direct contact
        - Convection ocurs when fluid becomes less dense when heated and rises - cooler fuid repaces it, creating a continuous cooling cycle

2- What effect does water's ability to dissipate heat have on a diver?

- Due to conduction and convection a diver needs insulation to remain comfortable in all but the warmest water
- Without a wet suit or dry suit, you will chill quickly:
    - Takes away from your enjoyment
    - Could lead to hypothermia
- You miss items when reaching for them, because they appear closer
    - Due to refraction

3- What does light do when it passes from air into water, or vice-versa, and how does this affect a diver?

- When light passes from a medium of one density to a medium of a different density it's speed changes and causes it to alter direction slightly - to "bend" or refact
- When diving, refraction results when light passes from watr through glass into the air in your mask
    - Objects are magnified - appear closer by a ratio of about 4.3
    - Objects appear larger or closer, depending upon the circunstances
- Example - fish that's founr metres/yards away will appear to be three metres/yards away
    - Appears 25 percent closer or 33 percent larger
- Most divers learn to compensate for refraction

4- Why does sound travel faster in water than in air, and approximately how much faster is it in water?

- Sound is energy that travels in waves
    - It can only exist and travel through matter
    - Generally travels best in dense media such as solids and liquids, like water
    - Elasticity of a substance determines how well sound travels through it
- Sound travels slightly more than four times faster in water than in air

5- How does the speed of sound in water affect hearing?

- You often can't tell where a sound is coming from underwater
    - Your brain determines direction based on the sligh difference in intensity and time when a sound reaches each of your ears
    - Underwater, it's the same (as far as your brain can tell) which makes it difficult to figure out direction
- Often, you perceive sound as being directly overhead
- Sometimes you can determine general diretion based on its frequency, distance away and intensity
