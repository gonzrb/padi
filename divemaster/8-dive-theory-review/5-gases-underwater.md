1- What is partial pressure?

- Air - approximately 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen
- Enriched air nitrox has a higher percentage of oxygen
- Technical divers may use three gases (trimix) - oxygen, nitrogen and helium
- Each gas exerts it's individual pressure indenpendently of other gas]ses
- Independent pressure is partial pressure
- In a cylinder filled with air, 21% of the pressure is from oxygen, while nitrogen exerts 79%

2- How does the physiological effect of breathing a given percent of a gas at depth compare to breathing the same percentage of the gas at the surface?

- Underwater, each breath has more molecules compared to a breath of same volume at the surface
    - The percentage of gas remains the same
    - The number of molecules increases
- If there is an impurity, a diver would take in more potentially harmful molecules with each breath
    - The deeper the dive, the more significant the physiologocal effects
- Example:
    - A cyliunder contains 04% carbon monoxide
    - At surface - headache in 1 to 2 hours
    - At40 m/132ft (5bar/ata)
        - Like breathing 2% carbon monoxide
            0.04 x 5 = 2
    - Immediately toxic
- Determine the partial pressure by multiplying the gas percentage by the absolute pressure
- Example:
    - A dive to 30m/99ft, breathing air - what is the partial pressure of oxygen?
        - 4bar/ata x 21 = 84bar/ata
    - Breathing oxygen can be toxic when the partial pressure exceeds 1.4bar/ata
        - Understanding limits and calculating gas partial pressures in crucial for enriched air diving and technical diving

3- What happens when you raise the pressure of a gas in contact with a liquid?

- When a gas is in contact with a liquid, it dissolves in proportionately to pressure
    - As pressure increases - more gas dissolves into liquid
- Gas does not dissolve instantly - it does so gradually
- Speed depends on:
    - Pressure of gas
    - Amount already dissolved
    - Solubility of gas in liquid
    - Surface area of contact
- Eventually, when the pressure of dissolved gas equials the pressure of gas in contact with liquid, no more gas will dissolve in or out
- A state of equilibrium is saturation

4- What happens when you reduce the pressure of a gas in contact with a liquid?

- Carbonated beverage - a good example of liquid with high content of gas dissolved into it
    - Under pressure - no bubbles - equilibrium
    - Pressure relieved - the gas comes out of solution
- If the difference between the dissolved gas and the surrounding pressure is not excessive - the gas comes out slowly
- If the difference exceeds critical point - bubbles form
