1- What are the organs, structure and functions of the circulatory and respiratory systems?

- Rules allow you to dive safety and avoid problems with your circulatory and respiratory systems.
	- Never hold your breath
	- Ascent slowly from every dive
- Besides rules, It's important to understand how diving effects your body's systems
- The systems work together to provide gas and nutrients to the body and eliminate waste
- Throguh blood, oxygen gets to the tissues via hemoglobin (a protein that carries and releases oxygen)
- After hemoglobin releases oxygen, it binds with carbon dioxide and carries it to the lungs for elimination
	- Another process - a reversible bicarbonate reaction - also carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs
- Blood is moved around by cardiovascular system - heart, arteries, veins and capillaries
	- The heart - a four chambered pump circulates the blood
	- Arteries carry blood away from the heart
	- Veins carry blood toward the heart
	- Capillaries are vessels between arteries and veins
	- Gas exchange occurs in the capillaries
- Cycle starts as oxygen-rich blood from lungs enters left side of heart and is pumped into the aorta
- Aorta branches into smaller arteries that branch in to even smaller arteries, until reaching capillaries
- Blood gives up oxygen, picks up carbon dioxide, then flows into the various system
- Veins branch into larger veins until a single vein returns oxygen poor blood to right side of the heart
- The heart pumps blood to lungs where it releases carbon dioxide into alveoli
- Blood picks up oxygen and returns to the heart
- Regarding the respiratory cycle - one key point
	- Reflex respiratory centers in the bran monitor
	- When the carbon dioxide level rises, the brain signals diaphragm to flex downward, resulting in an inhalation
	- Carbon dioxide level, not oxygen level, primarity triggers the breathing cycle
	- x`x`

2- What is dead air space and how do you avoid problems caused by it?

- You breathe slowly and deeply for a good air exchange
- Natural dead air space - sinuses, tranchea and brochi
- Your scuba regular and snorkel add volume to dead air space
- Slow deep breathing helps compensate for additioanl dead air space and avoid build up of carbon dioxide
- Shallow breathing raises carbon dioxide levels - increases breathing rate and can lead to overxertion
- To avoid ovexertion, always breathe slowly and deeply
- Stop to get your breath back under control

3- How does the body respond when breath-hold diving, and how you can extend breath-hold time?

- As breath hold diving grows in popularity people dive deeper and stay down longer on a single breath
- During a breath-hold dive, the circulatory system uses oxygen stored in the lunge, muscles and blood
- Underwater, pressure compresses air in the lungs, which allows blood to use more of the remaining oxygen
- As time goes by, carbon dioxide builds in the system, acusing the urge to breathe
- AS the urge grows stronger, the boy consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide
- Extend breath hold time using voluntary hyperventilation
	- Breathe eeply and rapidly for 3 o 4 breathes
- Excessie hyperventilation depletes carbon dioxide, delays the urge to breathe and may lead to shallow water blackout
	- The body consumes oxygen faster then carbon dioxide accumulates to stimulate breathing
	- At depth, there is no inmediate problem
	- As diver ascends and the partial pressure of oxygen falls abruptly
		- causes black out without warning

4- Why should you avoid a wetsuit hood or drysuit collar that excessively restricts the neck, and what are the two physiological explanations for the concern?

- Id a wetsuit or drysuit collar is too tight it constricts the carotid arteries and jugular veins
	- Blocked jugular various return and carotid sinus reflex reduce fresh blood flow to the brain
- Blocking jugular veins reduces flow to brain, because oxygen poo blood can't exit to make room for fresh blood
	- Raises blood pressure because the heart tries to push against restriction

5- What are the physiological effects of carbon monoxide while diving, and how do you avoid them?

- Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning happens most often outside of diving
- Breathing CO under pressure can be dangerous
	- Hemoglobin bonds with CO more than 200 times more readily than with oxygen - does nto unbond as easily 
	- Result - blood carries less and less oxygen
	- If left unchecked, blood may become incapable of carrying sufficient oxygen to the tissues
- When blood bonds with CO, it appears even redder than ussual
	- A diver's lips and nails beds may turn bright red
- Other signs and symptoms include headache, confusion and narrow vision
	- Mild symptoms subside after several hours of fresh air
	- In severe cases, give the diver pure oxygen and contact emergency medical care
- Carbon monoxide can originate from a compressor system problem
	- Excess CO can go uniticed at first because it lacks both odor and taste
- Fill your cylinder at a reputable fill station
- Smoking before a dive raises noral CO levels
	- Avoid rick by not smoking

6- What are the two types of oxygen toxicity, and how do you avoid them?

- Oxygen (O2) may become toxic when the partial pressure exceeeds 1.4 bar/ata
	- Technical divers may use a higher limit of 1.6 bar/ata during decompression only
	- Close circuit rebreather divers use a limit of 1.3 bar/ata
- You don't reach this partial pressure when breathing compressed air within the recreational diving limits
	- It's possible with enriched air nitrox
	- it's a concern for technical divers using high oxygen mixes and pure oxygen, for recompression
- Two types of oxygen toxicity - central nervous system (CNS) abd pulmonary
- CNS can occur when the oxygen partial pressure is greater than limits for a diving
- Signs and sympthoms include visual disturbances, ear ringing, nausea, twitching muscles, irritability, dizziness and convulsionn
- Most serious sign - convulsion
	- Underwater - the diver is nighly likely to drown
- Avoid CNS toxicity b being properly trained
- Pulmonary toxicity is caused by continuous exposure to elevated oxygen partial pressure 
	- above 5 bar/ata
	- unlikely in recreational diving
	- it could occur following multiple dives using enriched air or in technical diving
- Symptoms and signs include burining in the cheat and irritate cough
- Prevent it by following established oxygen exposure time limits

7- What is the primary first aid for a near drowning accident?

- Near drowning - when an individual suffers asphyxiantion in water but is revived
- To revive a nonbreathing diver, the primary first aid is inmediate rescue breathing
- CPR may be the next step
- Be prepared to turn the diver to the side if vomiting occurs - keep the airway clear
- Give the breathing diver emergency oxygen, keep the diver lying down and treat for shock
- Contat local EMS
- Near drowning patient may sem fully recovered
- Pateint should seek medical care, because in nearly all cases, water enters the lung
	- Water causes pysiological complications that interface with the lung's ability to exchange gases
	- Can cause secondary drowning which is fatal

8- How do you administer oxygen to breathing injured diver, and to a nonbreathing injured diver?

- Administring emergency oxygen may provide significate benefit to the diver
- For a breathing injured diver, provide the highest oxygen concentration possible by using a nonresuscitator demand valve - steps:
	- Slowly open the valve and test the unit by inhaling from the mask - do not exhale into the mask
	- Offer the diver the mask - either place it on the diver's face or allow the diver to hold the mask
	- Instruct the diver to breath normally
	- Monitor the oxygen pressure gauge
- If the diver is not breathing you can still provide oxygen while giving rescue braths by using a pocket mask
	-- Attach the oxygen tube from the continuous flow outlet to the pocket mask
	- Slowly open the valve and st flow rate at 15liters/min
	- Gibe rescue breaths through the pocket mask
