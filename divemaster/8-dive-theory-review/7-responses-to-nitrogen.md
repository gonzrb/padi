1- What cause gas narcosis, at approximately what depth is it likely using air/enriched air, and what are common signs/symptoms of it?

- You learned about nitrogen narcosis 
	- more correctly gas narcosis- early in your training
- Different gases cause a narcotic effec when nreathed under siffucient pressure - nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.
- Exact mechanism isn't fully understood, appears related to nerve impulse blockage
- Using air or EANs, most divers feel effects at about 30m/100 ft
	- it varies from person to person and day to day
	- Ascending to a shallower depth relieves symptoms
- Subtie sympthoms include slowed thinking, mild sense of euphoria or well being
- Deeper - thinking slows and motor skills deteriorate
- Judgment becomes imparied with ability to observe
	- Delays ability to recognize and solve problems


2- What are the physiological mechanisms by which the body absorbs and release nitrogen (or other inert gases) while diving? 

- - Gasses dissolve into liquids proportionally to pressure
- The human body is primairy water - when exposed to pressure - gases dissolve into doby tissues
	- Oxygen is used by the body, but nitrogen (any any other inert gas) is not
	- Nitrogen is a primary concern for recreational divers
- Nitrogen pressure in lungs is greater than in blood, nitrogen dissolves into blood, then into tissues
- The amount of nitrogen absorbed relates directly to the depth and duration of the dive
	- if you stay long enough, all tissues would saturate with nitrogen
- Disolved gas still exerts pressure within tissues
	- The body does not absorb and release nitrogen on a single time scale
	- Some tissues absorb gasses more slowly than others
	- Some dissolve more gas than other
- Calculate different absorption and release rates from theoretical tissues is the foundation of decompression theory models and dive tables
- On escent, nitrogen pressure in the tissues is higher than surrounding pressure
	- Pressure in blood exeeeds pressure in lungs
		- nitrogen dissolves from blood into alveoli
	- in the lungs and is exhaled
	- Lower blood tissue pressure
		- nitrogen dissolves from tissues into blood
- If difference is within limits, nitrogen dissolves harmiessly into blood and then slowly out through exhalations
- If the body has excess nitrogen that it can't eliminate as fast a it comes out of solution - bubbles form in the blood and tissues - that resunt in decompression sickness
- On many dives, some degree of bubbling does occur without causing decompression sickness
	- Asymptomatic bubbles are called silent bubbles

3- What causes decomrpession sickness (DOS), and what are the two types?

- DCS occurs when bubbles form in tissues with limited blood flow or on the arterial side of the circulatory system
	- In many types, the exact injury mechanism is still a mystery
- DCS tends to be delayed
	- in about half the cases, it appears within an hour
	- some take up to 36 hours
	- often worsens during first few hours
- Two types:
	- Type 1 - pain-only
		- Not inmediately life-threatening or likely to cause long-term disability
		- skin bends- a rash
	- Type 2 - affects the nervous system
		- May be inmediately life-threatening or debilitating
		- Signs and symptoms - tingling, numbness,paralysis, stroke-like symptoms, unconsciousness and cardiac or respiratory arrest
- Pulmonary DCS is a rare from that occurs when bubbles accumulate rapidly in the pulmonary capillaries, interfering with blood flow and gas exchange
- Cereblar DCS - occurs when bubbles travel to the brain and cause arterial gas ambolism
	- Signs and sympthoms include blurred vision, confusion, headache, unconsciousness and death


4- What factors may predispose a diver to DCS?

- Because everyone has a different physiology the predisposition to DCS varies from person to person
- Factors that may predispose a diver to DCS
	- Fat tissue - nitrogen is more soluble in fat
	- Age - circulatory systems become less efficient, an increased percentage of fat and reduced fitness could decrease nitrogen elimination
	- Dahydration - A reduced quantity of blood in circulation slows nitrogen elimination
	- Injures or illness -
		- injures areas could alter or restrit circulation leading to areas where nitrogen isn't eliminated quickly
		- illness that affect the efficiency of the circulatory system
	- Alcohol - Drinking alcohol before or after diving accelerates circulation, dilates capilaries and promotes dehydration - alters nitrogen elimination
	- Exess carbon dioxide - Increased levels can alter circulation and gas exchange
	- Colrd water - a diver starts a dive warm with normal circulation, but cools and circulation to the extremities is reduced - slowing nitrogen elimination
	- Heavy exercise
		- Working hard during a dive accelerates circulation - more nitrogen than normal dissolves into the body
		- After or immediately before a dive, heavy exercise accelerates circulation, altering nitrogen elimination and stimulating the production of microbubbles
