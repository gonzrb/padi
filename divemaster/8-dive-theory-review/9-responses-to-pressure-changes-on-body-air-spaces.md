1- How do the ears and sinuses respond to changing pressure?

- One of the first things you experience is pressure in your ears - you quicly learn to equialize pressure
- Your sinuses usually equialize with normal breathing - unless congested
- Knowing the structure and function of ears and sinuses will help you understand how they respond to changing pressure
- Ear - three areas
    - Outer
    - Middle 
    - Inner
- Outer ear - eternal ear and ear canal, which channels sound to eardrum
- Middle ar - air space connected to throat by eustachian tube
    - Separated from outer ear by the eardrum
    - Sound waves hit the eardrum and are transmitted thorguh small bones, called ossicles, to inner ear
- Inner ear turns vibrations from ossicles into nerve impulses - allowing you to hear
- During descent, water fills outer ear, putting pressure on eardrum
- Equialization occurs by adding air through eustachian tubes
- Failure to add air or a blockage causes a squeeze
- During ascent, expanding air normally exist easily
    - If a blockage prevents air from exiting, a reverse block occurs
- Sinuses are divided into four chambers connected to the nose
- Healthy sinuses have free air flow and normally equialize naturally
- Congested sinuses may experience a sinus squeeze on descent
- If congestion occurs during the dive, then a reverse block could result on ascent
- IF a squeeze or reverse block is not corrected quicly, a pressure-related injury - barotrauma - could occur
- Middle ear squeeze results in blod and fluid filling the middle ear until equilibrium is restored
    - The ears feel full and hearing is reduced
    - The injury needs proper treatment ot heal
    Failure to receive medical care can mean permanent hearing impairment

2- What injures or incidents may occur as a result of ear and sinus squeezes or reverse blocks?

- Eardrum rupture occurs when a diver descends rapidly without equializing - the eardrum flexes inward until it ruptures
- Water enters the air space to equialize the pressure
- This injury requires medical attention to prevent infection and permanent damage
- Another ear barotrauma is round window ropture
- If a diver delays equialization, the roudn window bulges outward in response to unequal pressure
- If at the same time, the diver attemps a long, forceful blow against a pinched nose, the increase in the internal pressure can rupture the round window
- This serious injury needs medical treatment and can lead to permanent hearing reduction or deafness
- Vertigo - characterized by dizziness or loss of sense of direction
    - Often result from ear barotrauma
        - For example, when an eardrup ruptures, the rush of cool water hitting inner ear will impair a diver's balance
        - Round window rupture or a severe squeeze can also cause vertigo
- Ear plugs aren't appropiate for scuba diving
    - Tight fitting hoods or anything that can obstruct the outer ear could also be a problem
- Obstruction creates an airspace that can't be equialized
    - During descent, the eardrum flexes toward the unequialized space, and can rupture outward
- Some special ear protectors and vented ear plugs made for scuba diving allow for equaliation
- During descvent, congedtion in the sinuses could result in a squeeze
    - Pressure or pain between the eyes, over the teeth or in the checkbones
    - Blood and fluid fill the sinus to restore pressure balance
- During ascent, accumulated fluids and blood often flow into the diver's mask
- Sinus squeeze usually heals on it's own, unless accompanied by entended pain or fever, suggesting a sinus infection
- Reverse block - occurs in the ears of sinuses if congestion prevents expanding air from escaping during ascent
- FOr the ears - eardrum flexes outward
    - If air not given a chance to work its way out, the eardrum could rupture outward
- For the sinuses - a slow ascent usually gives air a chance to work int's way out
    - Fluid and blood may flow from diver's nose, and extended pain or fever suggest a sinus infection

3- What are the causes and physiologies of mask and dry suit squeezes?

- You probably equialize the air space in your mask without even thinking about it
- Mask squeeze occurs most commonly on very rapid descents when a diver neglects to equialize the mask
    - Results in swollen facial tissues and capillary rupture in the skin and eyes
    - Looks dramatic, but generally clears without complications
- Dry suit squeeze occurs when a diver fails to add air to the dry suit when descending
    - The most common cause is a rapid descent with the dry suit inflator accidentally left disconnected
    - Cause pinching and can raise welts and caise skin injury
    - Severe squeeze can constrict breathing
    - Easily prevented using proper techniques

4- How do your lungs respond to changing pressure?

- Breathe continuously
- 

5- What are the causes and physiologies of the lung overexpansion injures, air embolism, pneumothorax, mediastinal exphysema and subcutaneous emphysema?
