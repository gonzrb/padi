1- How do the ears and sinuses respond to changing pressure?

- One of the first things you experience is pressure in your ears - you quicly learn to equialize pressure
- Your sinuses usually equialize with normal breathing - unless congested
- Knowing the structure and function of ears and sinuses will help you understand how they respond to changing pressure
- Ear - three areas
    - Outer
    - Middle 
    - Inner
- Outer ear - eternal ear and ear canal, which channels sound to eardrum
- Middle ar - air space connected to throat by eustachian tube
    - Separated from outer ear by the eardrum
    - Sound waves hit the eardrum and are transmitted thorguh small bones, called ossicles, to inner ear
- Inner ear turns vibrations from ossicles into nerve impulses - allowing you to hear
- During descent, water fills outer ear, putting pressure on eardrum
- Equialization occurs by adding air through eustachian tubes
- Failure to add air or a blockage causes a squeeze
- During ascent, expanding air normally exist easily
    - If a blockage prevents air from exiting, a reverse block occurs
- Sinuses are divided into four chambers connected to the nose
- Healthy sinuses have free air flow and normally equialize naturally
- Congested sinuses may experience a sinus squeeze on descent
- If congestion occurs during the dive, then a reverse block could result on ascent
- IF a squeeze or reverse block is not corrected quicly, a pressure-related injury - barotrauma - could occur
- Middle ear squeeze results in blod and fluid filling the middle ear until equilibrium is restored
    - The ears feel full and hearing is reduced
    - The injury needs proper treatment ot heal
    Failure to receive medical care can mean permanent hearing impairment

2- What injures or incidents may occur as a result of ear and sinus squeezes or reverse blocks?

- Eardrum rupture occurs when a diver descends rapidly without equializing - the eardrum flexes inward until it ruptures
- Water enters the air space to equialize the pressure
- This injury requires medical attention to prevent infection and permanent damage
- Another ear barotrauma is round window ropture
- If a diver delays equialization, the roudn window bulges outward in response to unequal pressure
- If at the same time, the diver attemps a long, forceful blow against a pinched nose, the increase in the internal pressure can rupture the round window
- This serious injury needs medical treatment and can lead to permanent hearing reduction or deafness
- Vertigo - characterized by dizziness or loss of sense of direction
    - Often result from ear barotrauma
        - For example, when an eardrup ruptures, the rush of cool water hitting inner ear will impair a diver's balance
        - Round window rupture or a severe squeeze can also cause vertigo
- Ear plugs aren't appropiate for scuba diving
    - Tight fitting hoods or anything that can obstruct the outer ear could also be a problem
- Obstruction creates an airspace that can't be equialized
    - During descent, the eardrum flexes toward the unequialized space, and can rupture outward
- Some speial ear protectors and vented ear plugs made for scuba diving allow for equaliation
