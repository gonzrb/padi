1- What arte the general rules and recommendations for diving with the Recreational DIve Planner, including those for flying anfter diving an emergency decompression?

- BOttom time is calculated beggining at descent and ending whern the dive starts durect ascen t to the surface
- Any dive planned to 10m/35ft or less is calculated as a dive to 10m/35ft
- Use the exact or next greater depth
- Use the exact or next greater time
- AScend slowly from all dives - no faster than 18m/60ft per minute
- be conservative and avoid maximum limits
- For dives in cold water or underr strecnuous conditions, plan dives assuming the depth is 4m/10ft deeper than actual
- Plan repetitive dives os each successive dive is to a shallower depth
    - Limnit repetitive dives to 30m/100ft
    - Plan multilevel dives with each level to a shallower depth
- Limit your maximum depoths to your training and experiece level
    - Open water divers - 10m/60ft
    - Experienced divers - 30m/100ft
    - Limit 40m/130ft
- A safety stop is recommended after every dive
    - After dives to 30m/100ft or deeper
    - Any time you are within three pressure groups of an NDL
- IF you are plannign 3 or more dives in a day:
    - Beginning with the fisrt dive - if you r ending pressure group after any dive is W or X, the minimum surface interval between all subsequent dives is 1 hour
    - IF your ending pressure group after any dive is Y or Z. the minimum surface interval bettween all subsequent dives is 3 hours
- IF you accidentally descend below 40m/130ft inmediately ascend at a rate not to exceed 18m/60ft per minute ot 5m/15ft and make an emergency decompression stop for 8 minutes
    - Any dive below 40m/130ft must be followed by a surface itnerval of at least 6 hours
- Provisions for emegency decompression stops are included as a safety factor
    - If a no dedcompression limti is exceeded by less than 5 minutes, an 8 minutes stop at 5m/15ft is mandatory. Upon surfacing remain out of the water for at least 6 hours
    - IF a no decompression limit is excedded by more than 5 minutes, a 5m/15ft stop of no less than 15 minutes is urged (air supply permitting). Upon surfacing, wait at least 24 hours prior to flying or making another dive
- regarding flying after diving
    - For a single dive, a minimum preflight surface interval of 12 hours is suggested
    - For repetitive dives and/or multiday dives, a minimum preflight surface interval of 18 hours is suggested
    - For dives requiring decompression stops, a minimum preflight surface interval greater than 18 hours is suggested

2- How do you find a no decompression limit for a first and repetitive dive using both the RDP Table and the eRDPml?

3- How do you calculate dive profiles for three or more repetitive dived using both the RDP Table and the eRDPml?

4- How do you plan a multilevel dive using the eRDPml?
