1- What are the different operating principles and designs for depth gauges, SPGs and compasses?

- Gauges provide information for planning your dive and diving your plan
- YOu need to understand how intruments - depth gauges, SPGs, compasses and dive computers - function so you can better advice divers you supervise a better handle problems
- Although many divers invest in a dive computer, there any many standard depth gauges still in use
- Three basic types:
    - Oil-filled analog gauges - have a sealed tube (bourdon tube) that coils with pressure
        - As depth increases, pressure is transmitted through the oil and the tube coils, moving the depth gauge needle
    - Diaphragm gauges - a flexible diaphragm taht senses chaning pressure is connected to levers and gears that move the needle to the corresponding depth
    - Digitaol gauges - read depth via a transducer that varies electrical transmission depending on pressure
        - Offer a high degree of accuracy
        - Same technology is used in dive computers
- Most common submersible pressure gauge (SPG) is on e that attaches to high pressure port via a hose
- An analog SPG uses a sealed tube to sense cylinder pressure
    - Increasing or decreasing pressure causes the tube to flex, which moves the needle around the dial
- Hoseless SPGs have a compact transmitter that threards into the high pressure port
    - The transmitter sends pressure information to a receiver in a dive computer worn on the wrist
- SPGs can be integrated into dive computers - either connected to a high pressure hose or packaged into a hoseless unit
