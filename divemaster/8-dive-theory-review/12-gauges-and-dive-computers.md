1- What are the different operating principles and designs for depth gauges, SPGs and compasses?

- Gauges provide information for planning your dive and diving your plan
- YOu need to understand how intruments - depth gauges, SPGs, compasses and dive computers - function so you can better advice divers you supervise a better handle problems
- Although many divers invest in a dive computer, there any many standard depth gauges still in use
- Three basic types:
    - Oil-filled analog gauges - have a sealed tube (bourdon tube) that coils with pressure
        - As depth increases, pressure is transmitted through the oil and the tube coils, moving the depth gauge needle
    - Diaphragm gauges - a flexible diaphragm taht senses chaning pressure is connected to levers and gears that move the needle to the corresponding depth
    - Digitaol gauges - read depth via a transducer that varies electrical transmission depending on pressure
        - Offer a high degree of accuracy
        - Same technology is used in dive computers
- Most common submersible pressure gauge (SPG) is on e that attaches to high pressure port via a hose
- An analog SPG uses a sealed tube to sense cylinder pressure
    - Increasing or decreasing pressure causes the tube to flex, which moves the needle around the dial
- Hoseless SPGs have a compact transmitter that threards into the high pressure port
    - The transmitter sends pressure information to a receiver in a dive computer worn on the wrist
- SPGs can be integrated into dive computers - either connected to a high pressure hose or packaged into a hoseless unit
- Two basic types of dive compasses:
    - Mechanical compasses are liquid filled
        - Allow compass to withstand pressure at depth
        - Allow needle to move smoothly within unit
    - Mechanical compasses either function with direct or indirect reading
        - Numbers either rotate as the bezel is moved
        - Numbers are fixed and only the index marks rotate
    - Electronic compasses are generally integrated into dive computers

2- What are the procedures for using dive computers appropriately?

- Most divers you supervise are likely to have dive computers - advice them to follow the manufacturer recommendations
- General guidelines when offering suggestions:
    - Know how to use the computer
    - PLan the dive by activating the computer and scrolling through the NDLs
        - Note the NDL for the next deeper depth
    - Each diver needs an individual computer, and that computer must stay with the diver for the entire day
- General guidelines when offering suggestions:
    - Dive the plan
        - Don't reise the plan just because the computer allows it - other than to cahnge thr plan to be more conservative
    - Stay well within the limits, and awscend to a shallower depth to avoid pushing the no stop time showing
    - Follow most conservative computer by heading shallower or ending dive if a computer nears a limit
    - Watch you SPG
        - often air supply limits the dive
        - not the NDL
    - PRogress from deep to shallow and avoid large increases in depth after ascending shallower
    - AScend slowly and make safety stops
    - If a ive computer fails during a dive, ascend, make a safety stop and end the dive

3- What speial equipment requirements and considerations do you have when diving with enriched air? 

- The guideline is that standard scuba regulaors, BCDs, SPGs and alternate air sources may be used with enriched air blends to to 40% oxygen
    - Follow manufacturer's guidelines and local regunaltions
- For technical diving with mixed more than 40%, scuba equipment must be cleaned to o2, service specificaitions, be made of o2, compatible materials and be lubricated with O2, compatible lubricants
- Enriched air cylinders must be dedicated cylinders that are clearly marked
    - May need to meet oxygen service standards based on manufacturer recommendations, local law or practice
- Before using an enriched air cylinder, each diver must analyze the contents
- Divers use oxygen analyzers, either their own or one available at eriched air fill station

4- What functional problems can occur with gauges and dive computers?

- Altough depth gauges and computers that are in good shape seldom give a subsantially inaccurate depth reading, mishandiling and wear can affect gauge accuracy
- Periodically check depth accuracy by comparing it to gauges of several other divers
- If a gauge appears off, have it checked by a qualified technician
- Regarding SPGs, most common problems result when dangling gauges snag and become damaged
    - Destroys the hose and gauge over time
    - Hardms aquatic ife
- Inspect the gauge and hose for signs of wear
    - Replace hoses at first signs of damage
- Look at needle before turning air on to make sure it reads zero
    - IF avobe zero, have the SPG serviced
- A mechanical SPG that consistently reads higher than actual pressure indicates metal fatiue
    - The bourdon tube flexes more easily than it should - allowing the needle to travel farther
    - The gauge need to be replaced
- Computer failure has become very rate
    - If there is a problem, or the battery is low, the computer will shut down or otherwise warn you
- If a dive computer fails between dives, the diver may continue diving if:
    - The diver has been diving with a backup for every dive
    - All divers have been recorded and can be calculated on a dive table
- If neither of these options are available, the diver must wait 12 to 24 hours before diving again
