1- What are meant by ambient, absolute and gauge pressures?

- At sea level, under the pressure of atmosphere - 1 bar or 1 ata
- Add an atmosphere for every 10m/33ft of seawater
- Add an atmosphere for every 10.3/34ft of fresh water

Depth    | Pressure
0m/0ft   | 1 bar/ata
10m/33ft | 2 bar/ata
20m/66ft | 3 bar/ata
30m/99ft | 4 bar/ata

- Ambient pressure means "surrounding pressure"
    - Pressure that exist at a defined moment
    - Expressed as the absolute or gauge pressure, depending upon purpose
- Absolute pressure i the total rpessure

- Gauge pressure ignores the atmospheric pressure
    - At sea level, gauge pressure is zero
    - At 10m/33ft in seawater, gauge pressure is 1bar/ata

2- What is the relationship between changes in absolute pressure and gas volume?

- As pressure increases, te volume of air in a flexible container will decrease
- Decreasing volume is the reason you equialize
- As pressure decreases on ascent, the volume of air in a flexible contaienr will increace
- Reason for the most important rule in scuba diving - never hold your breath

Depth    | Pressure  | Air Volume 
0m/0ft   | 1 bar/ata | 1          
10m/33ft | 2 bar/ata | 1/2        
20m/66ft | 3 bar/ata | 1/3        
30m/99ft | 4 bar/ata | 1/4        

3- What is the relationship between depth and gas density?

 As pressure increases, the volume of an air space decreases and the density increases
- Increases in gas density affects air consumption
- Example - 2 hours to breathe full cylinder at surface
    - At 10m/33ft - 1 hour (1/2 the time)
    - At 30m/99ft - 30 minutes (1/4 the time)
- Scuba cylinder is inflexible container filled at high pressure - only when air is exposed to surrounding pressure does pressure, volume and density relationship exist

Depth    | Pressure  | Air Volume | Air Density
0m/0ft   | 1 bar/ata | 1          | x1
10m/33ft | 2 bar/ata | 1/2        | x2
20m/66ft | 3 bar/ata | 1/3        | x3
30m/99ft | 4 bar/ata | 1/4        | x4

4- What is the relationship of the pressure, volume and temperature of a gas?

- You should not leave a full cylinder in a car in the sun on a very hot day - pressure could increase an rupture burst disk
- Raising temperature - adds energy:
    - Molecules move more rapidly
    - Motion causes uncontained gas to expand or contained gas pressure to rise
- Inflexible container
    - Increase in temperature
        - Volumen does't change
        - Presure increases
    - Decrease in temperature
        - Pressure decreases
- Flexible container
    - Increase in temperature
        - Volumen increases
    - Decrease in temperate
        - Volumen decreases
