1- What steps should you take to plan and prepare for a deep dive?

- Deep diving is defined in recreational diving as dive between 18m/60ft and 40m/130ft
- Takes more planning and preparation due to:
    - Shorter no decompression limits
    - Potential effects of gas narcosis
    - Use air more quicly
- Ear a PADI Deep Diver certification
- To supervise deep dives, consider the needs and capabilities of the divers:
- First, have a clear reasonable dive objective - dive time is limited:
    - Example - on a large wreck, limit exploration to part of the wreck
    - Minimize stress and avoid task loading with a simple objective
- Next, review and check dive equipment:
    - Scuba cylinders large enough and full
    - Enough exposure protection for temperature at depth
    - Alternate air sources positioned correctly and everyone familiar with buddy's configuration
- Next, review and check dive equipment:
    - If using a dive computer, be familar with use
    - If using a depth gauge, timing device and RDP know no decompression limit for planned depth and deeper depths
    - Carry a dive light to bring out colors, read gauges and keep track of buddy in lower visibility
- Consider other equipment:
    - Reference line for ascents and descents
    - Emergency breathing equipment positioned at the safety stop
    - Extra weights at safety stop
        - Clipped to the line or in a mesh bag

2- What factors should you take into account when supervising a deep dive?

- Anytime you supervice a dive, you want proper preparation, clear communication, a good vantage point and the ability to deal with problems
- Factors to consider for supervising a deep dive:
    - How experienced the divers are:
        - Less experience - provide more information
        - More experience - remind divers of key safety points
    - Remind divers to make contigency plans for accidentally exceeeding depth and time
    - Potential for going deeper than planned
        - Diving along a wall or slope increases the risk of going below planned depth - best vantage point is to lead
        - Diving on flat bottom - best vantage point in water, but following rather than leading
        - Diver confirm, skill and attitude
            - Use your judgement - you may choose to stay closer to certain divers dependin on what you see 
            - During dive - you may change position to prevent or quicly respond to problems
            - End or modify dive if divers appear uncomfortable
                - ascend to a shallower level or end the dive

3- What are the procedures for preventing or dealing with gas narcosis, low-on or out-of-air emergencies and decompression inllness?

- During a deep dive, nitrogen or gas narcossis typically becomes noticeable at approximately 30m/100ft
    - At fist, the effect are subtle - slowed thinking and mild euphoria
    - Effects increase with depth - motor skills deteriorate, judgment impaired and slower response to a problem
- To reduce risk of problems with narcosis, plan deep dives shallower than 30m/100ft
- IF a diver becomes impaired
    - have buddy team or group ascend to shallower depth or en the dive
- Air consumption is greater at depth - primary concern is increased risk of lowe-on-air or out-of-air emergency
- Prevention - continually monitor air suppo and ascend with enough air to complete a safety stop
- Remind divers to watch their SPGs
    - Have them tell you when they reach an air consumption point
    - Encourage them to slow down
- Having emergency breathing equipment at the safety stop allows low-on-air divers to complete stop
- Out-of-air emergencies are dangerous:
    - Two divers breathing from one cylinder have increased breathing rates due to stress
    - Anxiety may cause divers to ascend at faster rate
- Without jeopardizing your safety, support low-on-air or out-of-air diver and buddy
        - Have buddy team with one diver low-on-air star up inmediately
        - You may decide to escort team so there are two divers with alternate air sources available
        - If diver is very low-on-air switch diver to alternate air source to avoid running out-of-air on ascent
- If diver runs out of air, get settled on buddy's or your alternate air source and ascend
- Monitor everyone's gas suppy and be prepared to swtich the diver to another alternate air source
- Keep in mind that after the safety stop, out-of-air diver will need alternate to surface or need to take emergency cylinder up
- To reduce the risk on DCI, remind and encourage divers to practice safe diving practices:
    - Stay well within planned depth and time limits
    - Slowly ascend and make a safety stop
    - Remain hydrated
    - Avoid strenuous exercise before and after the dive
    - Watch air supply closely
- IF you suspect DCI, follow there steps:
    - Begin with a primary assessment
    - Contact emergency care
    - Encourage the diver to lie down and relax
    - Have the diver breathe emergency oxygin
    - Manage shock
    - Arrange for emergency evacuation and medical care
