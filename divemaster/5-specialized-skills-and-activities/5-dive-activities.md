1- What general equipment, concerns and procedures apply when supervising each of the following activities:
    - Boat diveing?
    - Altitude diving?
    - Drift diving?
    - Shore diving when divers must enter though surf?
    - Night diving?
    - Cold water diving?
    - Enriched air diving?
    - Technical diving?

- Boat diving:

- You may have the opportunity to supervise dive activities form a variety of boats
- Procedures depend on whetheer you are the divemaster only or part of the boat crew
    - Divemaster only - your functions involve diving activities
    - IF employed as boat crew, will also assist with boat operations
- Regardless of the boat be familiar with equipment
    - Lines used to guide divers, moor or anchor the boat
    - Boat safety equipment - personal flotation devices, fire extinguishers, life rings, signal devices, communication devices, etc
    - Dive safety equipment - dive flags, emergency oxygen, firt aid kit, etc
- When divers arrive, take care of administrative paperwork
    - Assuption of risk/liability release
    - Dive roster and certification information
- Help divers slow or set up equipment
    - Remind divers to keep equipment organized
    - Work in and out of bag to reduce clutter
- Orient divers to boat facilities and rules
    - Areas off-limits, dry areas whjere to put cameras, etc
    - Advice divers prone to seasickness about taking medication and staying on deck in center of boat
        - Point out the leeward rail
- Evaluate conditions
    - discuss with captain and crew
- Conduct a complete dive briefing covering boat-specific entries/exits, current lines, surface signals and emergency recall
- Observe divers as they get ready
    - offer assistance
- Monitor as divers enter the water
    - FI supervising from the boat watch and be ready
    - If supervising in the water - be aware of changes in water conditions and movement
- After the dive, call roll or make a visual check for small groups
    - Make sure you actually see each diver
- Make sure equipment is stowed
- Follow local goverment regulations and required boating practices

- Altitude diving:

- You should have a basic understanding of altitude diving, even if you do not live in an area where it's popular
    - Procedures account for the fact that decompression models were developed for use at sea kevek
- Altitude dive is conducted above 300m/1000ft 
    - Maximum 3000m/10000ft
- Proper exposure protection is important for cooler water
- Have a depth gauge or dive computer that provides accurate measurement
    - some older gauges may not
- Going from lower altitude to higher altitude - driving up a mountain - you ascend from greater pressure with a higher nitrogen level in body
    - You can remain at the dive site altitude fro 6 hours or longer to permit body nitrogen to equilibrate
    - To dive sooner, account for nitrogen by determining a presure group letter for use on the RDP

Take an altitude Diver Speciality Course or refer to the PADI Adventures in Diving Manual

- If divers use the RDP to plan dives, they also need the Theoretical Depth at Altitude table
- Find these in the Adventures in Diving Manual
- Remind divers to place themselves because thin air will make them tire more easily
- Recommend a dive plan that minimizes strenuous activity at the surface

- Drift diving:

- Drift diving is typically conducted from a boat, but is also possible from shore, in rivers and in ares with strong tidal current
- Depending on local protocols:
    - You might or mnight not tow a surface marker buoy or float
    - Remind divers of towing techniques - not attaching buoy to equipment, being ready to let go and avoid entanglement
- It's a good idea to have divers carry surface signaling devices
