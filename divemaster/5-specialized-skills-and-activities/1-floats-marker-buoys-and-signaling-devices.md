1- How do you det a dive float?

- One of your duties may be to set the dive float
- Float serves several purposes:
    - Display a dive flag to warn boat traffic
    - Serves as a surface support station
    - Provides a descent and ascent reference
- Types of floats - small buoys to commercially designed large units with fabir covers
- Anchoring methods:
    - Weight belt or weights attached to line
    - Small anchor
    - Auger to screw into soft bottom
    - Line or clips to tie or clip to mooring or inanimate object
- Guidelines to fllow:
    - Be familiar with the float and attachment method
    - Have a good idea of where you will set the float
        - Familiar with the site
        - Snorkel the area
        - Explore the site on scuba
    - When anchoring, augering, tying or clipping float
        - Do not damage or disturb aquatic life with attachment or attached line
        - Think about where descending divers will land
    - Consider water movement, current and tidal change
        - Leave enough scope to account for swell and tide
        - Be aware of what will happen if current shifts
        - Make sure line won't damage aquatic life or put too much stress on anchor
    - Plan your dive to remove float or get it at the end of the dive day

2- What is the purpose of surface marker buoys and how do you properly use the various types?

- Surface marker buoys serve a range of purposes:
    - Marking boundaries for mapping project
    - Marking locations, routes and boundaries for search and recovery operations
    - Alerting boat traffic to presence of a diver
    - Allowing people on shore or boat to identify diver's location
    - Providing visual reference for ascent
    - Delayed surface marker buoys
- You will likely use surface marker buoys
- Consider these points:
    - If securing a buoy, take care to not harm or disturb aquatic life
    - If towing a buoy, hold the line or reel so you can let it go inmediately
    - Do not attach buoy to your equipment
    - Be aware of the line and ensure other divers keep clear to avoid entanglement
    - If using a delayed surface marker buoy - DSMB- be aware of local practices
    -Follow there guidelines:
        - Prepare buoy in advance
            - properly attached to reel
        - When launching, check for object and divers above
        - Keep line tight and away from your equipment, then inflate carefully
        - Keep line tight to surface, which keeps buoy upright

3- As a divemaster, what signaling and safety devices should you carry and know how to use?

- Cerfitifed asstants need two surface signaling devices - one audible and one visual
    - Audible - whistle or air horn
    - Visual - signal morror, surface marker buoy, inflatable signal tube or emergency strobe
- If you work on a dive boat, be familiar with the location and operation of safety equipment
