1- What are the general steps for mapping a dive site, and what elements do you include in a dive site map?

- You have been assigned to map a dive site:
    - Broardens your awareness of the dive environment
    - Gives you practice with underwater navigation
    - Enchances your ability to communicate with your buddy and coordinate activities underwater
- When you completed your map, use it:
    - As a visual guide during briefings
    - To show divers local facilities, entry, exit and point of interest
- AS a navigation reference
- To observe changes in the dive site over time
- First steps is to gather tools:
    - Compass
    - Large slate and pencil
    - Surface marker buoys
    - Line or measuring device
    - Lined or graph paper, plus ruler or protractor or computer program
- Determine map boundaries
    - Identify a central or reference point
    - Get in the water and mark those points
- Choose a search pattern
    - Example - U-pattern
    - Use kick cycles as a general measurement
    - Measure specific feature more accurately
- Work together
    - One controls pattern while other counts kicks cycles and keeps notes
    - Agree on how you will communicate
- One each leg, note features and distances
- Note distance when you hit specific depths to show contour
    - At regular intervals
    - Large depth changes such as drop offs
- When you have gatthered all data, create your map
- IF drawing the map by hand
    - Transfer data to lined or graph paper to keep heading angles, feature placement and depth contours accurate
    - Finish by copying to another sheet while fine-tuning
- If using a computer program, use available tools such as background grids and layers to keep data accurate and to add details
- Fill in shoreline, facility and topside features such as moorings
