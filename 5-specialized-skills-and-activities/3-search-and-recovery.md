1- What are five general steps in planning a search and recovery dive?

- As a dive professional, you will occasionally be involved in search and recovery operations
    - Dropped equipment
    - Missing diver
- Know how to plan and execute a search and recovery dive
- Earn PADI Search and Recovery Diver certification

- Steps to plan a search and recovery dive:
    - Clearly define dive objective
        - Simple search or complicated operation?
    - Collect and analyze information to determine risks and improve efficiency
    - Decide whether to scuba dive or snorkel
    - Choose a buddy or assign dive teams
    - Conduct a complete briefing - specific tasks, safety considerations, time limits and recall procedures

2- What general considerations should you take into account when using search patterns?

- Goal - cover the search are as quicly and efficiently as possible without leaving gaps

- There are several search patterns you can use:
    - Exdanding square:
        - Good for looking in inmediate area
        - Does not require any special equipment
    - The U-pattern:
        - Good for searching a large area for a medium to large object
    - Circular or semicircular rope pattern:
        - Effective for small object over unobstructed bottom
        - One diver is pivot point while other diver swims
        - Circle expands or semicircle moves along baseline
    - Jackstay
        - Good choise for finding small object in large area
        - Divers place line on bottom and search along length, then move it perpendicular for next leg
- Pick the best pattern based on search area, boottom topography, divers and equipment available
    - Would not use rope pattern on uneven bottom
- When choosing and executing a pettern:
    - Begin search at specific location
    - Use simplest pattern that will work
    - Use simple compass points - N,S,E and W
    - Have one buddy navigate while other looks
    - Sketch pattern on slate and use it to keep track

3- What is the procedure for lifting an object ot the surface with a lift bag?

- Once you have located a missing object and marked it, double check that your lift bag has capacity close to the object's negative buoyancy
    - Too small - won't lift object
    - Too large - ascent difficult to control
- You want the bag nearly full so that expanding air bubbles out - greater control
    - Most lift bags have dump valves that allow venting
- Next step is to attach bag to object - tie or clip
- Useful knots:
    - Bowline
    - Sheet bend
    - Two half-hitches
- When secured, test rigging by pulling
- Use alternate air source, or accessory inflator to slowly add air:
    - Pull rigging to test if off bottom
    - Fill lift bag close to neutral
    - Be ready to dump air
- Depending on conditions, accompany bag or allow it to rise independently
- If accompanying it, mantain control by dumping air:
    - Mantain proper ascent rate
    - Position yourself off to the side
    - If it starts to runaway, let it go
- On the surface, add air to ensure positive buoyancy
- Get assitance to remove the object
