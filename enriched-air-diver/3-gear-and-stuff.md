1- What is the primary concern regarding enriched air and scuba equipment?

- THe primary concern regarding enriched air and your dive equipment is the high oxygen content. Some materials burn or explode readily when in contact with high oxygen gas blends (or pure oxygen), even at normal room temperature. Exposure to high oxygen gas blends may also cuase some types of equipment material to deteriorate rapidly.

- These problems arise because fire, exposion and deterioration are forms of oxidation - a chemical reaction involving oxygen. The more oxygen in contact with a material, the more readily oxidation can occur.

2- What are the requirements and recommendations for scuba equipment (other than cylinders) used with enriched air with up to 40 percent oxygen?

- The common dive community guideline is that scuba regulators, BCDs SPGs ane alternate air sources may be used with enriched air blends that have up to 40% oxygen without modification.
- Gas mixes with more than 40% oxygen require equipment that has been cleaned to xygen service specifications.
- Follow all manufacturer recommendations with respect to using equipment with enriched air.
- The use of oxygen compatible lubricants.
- You should have your regulator serviced at least annually, preferably by a scuba technician quialified to work on enriched air equipment.
- Local law or standards may require that all equipment used with enriched air be cleaned to oxygen service specifications.

3- Why does enriched air diving required a dedicated cylinder?

- Even when you can use the regulator you already have for enriched air nitrox with up to 40% oxygen, you will need a dedicated cylinder. There are two reasons:
    - It's important that no one accidentally confuse an enriched air cylinder for a one of normal air. 
    - One common method for blending enriched air required putting pure oxygen in the cylinder and then adding oxygen compatible air. This is called "partial pressure blending". Because the cylinder valve and interior will be in contact with pure oxygen, if partial pressure blending with oxygen will be used, the cyliunder must meet oxygen service standards even if the final enriched air blend will have less than 40% oxygen. The standard scuba cylinder doesn't meet these requirements.

4- What color coding, stickers (decals) and tags should an enriched air cylinder have?

- Enriched air cylinders have standarixed stickers and/or tags and color coding generally agreed upon and accepted by the broad international dive commmunity.
    - Yellow cylinders should have a 10 centimetre/4inch green band around the shoulder with yellow or white lettering reading "Enriched Air", "Enriched Air Nitrox", "Nitrox", or similar.
    - Non-yellow cylinders should have a 15 centimetre/6inch band around the shoulder. THe top and bottom fo this band should be a yellow 2.5cm/1inch with the center 10cm/4in, of green. The green portion should have yellow or white lettering reading "Enriched Air", "Enriched Air Nitrox", "Nitrox", or similar.
    - Like any scuba cylinder, an enriched air cylinder should have a dated visual inspection sticker (decal) or stamp stating that the cylinder has been inspected for corrosion, stress, etc, for enriched air use, it should also have a sticker stating whether it does or does not meet oxygen service standards.
    - An enriched air cylinder should have a content sticker, or permanent tag.
    - Although these are the broadly accepted markings, in some areas local laws, regulations and standards set differing or additional requirements. 

5- What are the two primary concerns associated with filling enriched air cylinders, and how are they avoided?

- There are two concerns with filling enriched air cylinders that you don't have when filling a normal air cylinder. 
    - Fire/explosion hazard - Many substances readily burn or explode when in contact with pure oxygen or high proportion of oxygen. These substances include trace hydrocarbons (lubricants) found in normal compressed scuba ir. Trace lubricants accumulate over time in a standard air cylinder. This creates a hazard inmediately if oxygen were put into the cylinder. This is why blenders use oxygen compatible air for partial pressure blending.
    - PErcentage of oxygen in the blend - The amount of oxygen in an enriched air blend affects your no stop time and oxygen exposure. If the content changes for more than 1%, your maximum allowable depth and no decompression limits will change.

- To manage these concerns, enriched air blenders are tranined to follow strict guidelines with procedures and special equipment that aren't needed for air fills. 

6- Why should only quialified, reputable enriched air blenders fill enriched air cylinders?

- Attempting to blend enriched air without following proper filling procedures can be very hazardous. NEver put pure oxygen in a standard cylinder an fill it or have it filled from a conventional scuba air fill station in an attempt to make enriched air. 

7- What is the potential hazard of improper enriced air filling procedures?

- This practice poses a high risk of fire or explosion.

8- What should you do if an enriched air cylinder or oxygen-serviced equipment is use with standad compressed air?

- Take it to an enriched air fill center. They treat the fill as enriched air in all respects, including marking it EAXNx21, analyzing the content and completing all records. IF an enriched air cylinder is accidentally filled from a conventional air source, it most be serviced and cleaned by someone quialified to service enriched air equipment

9- How do you identify qualified enriched air blenders and enriched air service?

- YOu can identify qualified enriched air blenders and enriched air service by looking for the following:
    - Gas quality verification
    - Proper procedures, cyliunder markings, analysis and record keeping
    - Documentation

10- What are the two most commonly used blends of enriched air?

- The two most common blends are:
    - EANx32, also known as "NOAA Nitrox I"
    - EANx36, also known as "NOAA Nitrox II"
