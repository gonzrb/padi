1- What is "enriched air"?

- Air consist approximately 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. Enriched air has been enriched with oxygen (had oxygen added), so it has more than 21% oxygen. Enriched air is any nitrogen/oxygen gas blend with more than 21% oxygen

- The purpose is not to have more oxygen but to have lower porpotion of nitrogen

- It has many names: "EANx", "EAN", "nitrox" and "enriched air"

2- What is the primary benefit of using enriched air?

- The primary benefit of using enricjed air nitrox is that it exposes you to less nitrogen than when you dive with air. This provides some advantages:
    - It extends your allowwable bottom time
    - It reduces any need to "push" the air no decompression limits
    - It reduces your overall nitrogen load on multiple dives

3- How does using enriched air affect no stop limits?

- The higher the oxygen content of the EANx blend, the less nitrogen you breathe. Within limits, your body metabolizes or otherwise absorbs oxygen, so it does not contribute to bubble formation after a dive. This means that compared to air, for a given dive you absorb less nitrogen. This allowes longer no decompression limits.
- The amount of added no stop time compared to air is even longer when you combine enriched air with an enriched air computer. This is because you benefit from the extended dive times that result from both lower nitrogen absortion and from slower absorption when you ascend to a shallower depth on a multilevel profile.
- The advantage of enriched air becomes especially evident when you make two or more dives because you have less residual nitrogen reducing your repetitive dive times. So the quantity of enricjed air you have in your cilinder is what limits you, not the no stop limits. 

4- Why is it too simplistic to say enriched air is safer than air when diving well within air no decompression limits?

- Thhough data collected since the early 1990s and field experience, the enriched air no decompression limits and concepts have establkished themselves as being as reliable as those of normal air. 
- Although you reduce your nitrogen exposure with enriched air, keep in mid that you increase your oxygen exposure. Oxygen has its own set of potential problems, os of which, if disregarded, can be significantly more hazardous than problems associated with nitrogen.

5- How does using enriched air affect narcosis when diving?

- Nitrogen narcosis is a well known problem from divers. Although enriched air reduces the amount of nitrogen you breathe underwater, many diving physiollogists believe ti does not significantly reduce narcosis. Thi is because, theoretically, oxygen has about the same narcotic potential as nitrogen. TThis means you should plan an enriched air dive accounting for narcosis just as you would using air.

- Keep in mind susceptibility to narcossi difers and may change from diver to diver.

6- What are three advantages of using an enriched air dive computer for enriched air diving?

- Today most divers use dive computers when they dive enriched air nitrox to benefit from three primary advantages:
    - Computers combine enriched air with multilevel diving for the most no stop time possible. 
    - Most models will or can be set to alert you if you accidentally exceed the maximum depth for your gas blend. 
    - Dive computers simplify diving planning and execution by calculating both your oxygen exposure and your allowable no stop time.
