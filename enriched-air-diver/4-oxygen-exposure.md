1- What is meant by oxygen partial pressure?

- Oxygen partial pressure referes to the pressure exerted only by the oxygen part of the blend, hence the name "partial" pressure - it is only part of the total pressure. In diving partial pressure is usually expressed in "atmostpheres" and abbreviated "ata from "atmostpheres absolute". An atmosphere or bar, as you may call it from your Open Water Diver course, is pressure equal to the air pressure surrounding us at sea level. 

2- How does exposure to increased oxygen partial pressure affect allowable dive time?

- The higher oxygen partial pressures you experience with enriched air nitrox must be kept within limits to avoid oxygen toxicity. Which can be a serious hazard. This means that exposure to increased oxygen partial pressure decreases your allowable dive time.

3- What are the maximum and contingency oxygen partial pressure limits?

- Besides oxygen exposure over time, there are oxygen partial pressure limits that you most stay within regardless of time. The maximum oxygen partial pressure limit for enriched air diving is 1.4ata/bar. The contingency oxygen partial pressure limnit is 1.6ata/bar. Dives beyond this limit have the potencial for inmmediate oxygen toxicity.
