1- What is meant by oxygen partial pressure?

- Oxygen partial pressure referes to the pressure exerted only by the oxygen part of the blend, hence the name "partial" pressure - it is only part of the total pressure. In diving partial pressure is usually expressed in "atmostpheres" and abbreviated "ata from "atmostpheres absolute". An atmosphere or bar, as you may call it from your Open Water Diver course, is pressure equal to the air pressure surrounding us at sea level. 

2- How does exposure to increased oxygen partial pressure affect allowable dive time?

- The higher oxygen partial pressures you experience with enriched air nitrox must be kept within limits to avoid oxygen toxicity. Which can be a serious hazard. This means that exposure to increased oxygen partial pressure decreases your allowable dive time.

3- What are the maximum and contingency oxygen partial pressure limits?

- Besides oxygen exposure over time, there are oxygen partial pressure limits that you most stay within regardless of time. The maximum oxygen partial pressure limit for enriched air diving is 1.4ata/bar. The contingency oxygen partial pressure limnit is 1.6ata/bar. Dives beyond this limit have the potencial for inmmediate oxygen toxicity.

4- What is the primary hazard of exceeding the oxygen exposure limits?

- There are two types of oxygen toxicity rhat can occur by exceeding oxygen limits. 
    - Fatal accident due to convulsing and drowning. This can happen due to central nervous system (CNS) toxicity.
    - Pulmonar Oxygen toxicity

5- What six signs and symptoms may procede a convulsion caused by oxygen toxicity?

- The warning signs and symptoms for oxygen toxicity include:
    - visual disturbances, including tunnel vision
    - ear ringing
    - nausea
    - twiching or musde spasms, specially in the face
    - irritability, restlessness, euphoria or anxiety
    - dizziness

- Some divers remember these by remembering VENTID.
- If you experience any CNS toxicity symtoms, end the dive by beggining a normal ascent inmediately.

6- What should you do if you accidentally exceed the oxygen exposure limits for your computer?

- If you accidentally exceed the maximum oxygen exposure limits for your computer, ascend immediately but slowly, make a safety stop and end the dive. Do not dive for 24 hours, or as stipulated by the computer manufacturer.
