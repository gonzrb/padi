1- Who must personally verify the analysis of the oxygen content in an enriched air cylinder before it is used?

- Regardless of how it's blended or where you obtain it, before diving with a cylinder of enriched air nitrox you must analyze it to confirm the percentage of oxygen. You need to know the percentage so you can set your enriched air dive computer, and you must be sure that the oxygen percentage is what the blender says it is.

2- What are the procedures for analyzing enriched air?

- Oxygen analyzers come in different sizes and types, some read out digitally and others, use analog gauges. Whatever type, for analyzing enriched air you need one that reads to one-tenth of a percentage. Different types and models of analyzers have their unique feature, but in general, the following steps apply:
    - Turn the analyzer on.
    - Flow the enriched air you are abalyzing into the analyzer at the same rate you used the calibration
    - Don't blow into the sensor because your breath contains mosture, which affects accuracy and reduces the sensor life.
    - Check your analyzer periodically againts other analyzers and replace ti's rensor if it performs outside the tolerance levels specified bu the manufacturer, and at intervals specified by the manufacturer
    - If you ever question the accuracy of an analyzer, compare it against one or more analyzers known to be accurate, and/or a gas of known analysis

3- What is standard of practice for the accuracy of enriched air analysis?

- The standard of practice for enriched air is plus or minus 1%. Minor variations (less than 1%) between the blender's analysis and yours are normal. but a substancial variation should be confirmed by using another analyzer.

4- What cylinder marking should you check to compare your analysis against?

- After analyzing the cylinder contents, compare your analysis with the contents tag or sticker on the cylinder. In some cases, the sticker or tag may already be partially completed, and you verify and finish filling it out. 
- After checking and completing the content sticker/tag, you will also sign the enriched air fill station fill log.
